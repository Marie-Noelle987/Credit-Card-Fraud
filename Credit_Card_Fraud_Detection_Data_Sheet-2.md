# Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset - Data Sheet

## Motivation
- **Purpose**: This dataset was created to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The goal is to address the imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions and improve fraud detection accuracy.
- **Dataset Creators**: The dataset was provided by the Machine Learning Group of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles).
- **Funding**: Not specified in the source.

## Composition
- **Instances**: The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction records with each instance representing a transaction.
- **Total Instances**: 284,807 records.
- **Labels**: The dataset is labeled with two classes: '0' (non-fraudulent) and '1' (fraudulent).
- **Features**: 30 features including 'Time', 'Amount', and 28 anonymized features (V1 to V28) derived via PCA.
- **Confidentiality**: The dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Data Split**: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The split preserves the class imbalance.

## Collection Process
- **Acquisition**: The data represents real-world credit card transactions collected over a period of time, but the specific acquisition details are not provided.
- **Sampling**: The dataset is imbalanced with 492 fraud cases and 284,315 non-fraud cases.
- **Time Frame**: Transactions were collected over two days in September 2013.
- **Ethics**: Anonymized data ensures privacy and confidentiality.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning
- **Preprocessing**: Features were scaled, and the dataset was resampled using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the class distribution.
- **Raw Data**: The raw data includes both non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions, and features are anonymized.

## Uses
- **Potential Uses**: Fraud detection, anomaly detection, research on imbalanced datasets.
- **Risks**: Since the dataset is anonymized, there are no privacy concerns, but care must be taken when applying the model in other domains to avoid bias.
- **Restrictions**: The dataset should not be used to derive any sensitive information about individuals.

## Distribution
- **External Distribution**: The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle under a public license.
- **License**: The dataset is distributed under the CC0: Public Domain license.

## Maintenance
- **Responsibility**: The dataset is maintained by the Machine Learning Group of ULB.
